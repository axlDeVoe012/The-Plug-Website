          <h2>What is Cannabis?</h2>
          <p>
            Cannabis is a plant that contains compounds called cannabinoidsâ€”mainly THC and CBD.
            It's used for relaxation, pain relief, anxiety, and other therapeutic or recreational benefits.

          <h2>THC vs. CBD</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>THC</strong> is psychoactive and produces a "high" effect.

          <h2>Ways to Use Cannabis</h2>
          <p>
            You can smoke, vape, eat, or apply cannabis. Edibles take longer to kick in, while vaping and smoking work quickly.
            Each method affects the body differently.

            Always follow local laws and avoid driving or operating machinery while under the influence.
