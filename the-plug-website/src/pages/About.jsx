      <h4>🌱 Executive Summary</h4>
      <p>
        The Plug is a proudly local cannabis dispensary and lounge based in a privately permitted residence in Soweto. While the lounge is still in the pipeline, the dispensary already provides high-quality products for both recreational and wellness-focused consumers. We’re self-funded, aiming to grow through support from investors and government initiatives. Our bold vision: to become the number one supplier of affordable, reliable cannabis in townships.
